    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1  pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make Sauce<p> Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
        <li>Cook spaghetti <p>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time</p></li>
        <li>Finish it! <p>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</p></li>
    </ol>
